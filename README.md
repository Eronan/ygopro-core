# edo9300's YGOPro script engine.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edo9300/ygopro-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edo9300/ygopro-core)

A bleeding-edge fork of [YGOPro core](https://github.com/Fluorohydride/ygopro) with updates to accommodate for new cards and features. It is incompatible with forks not derived from this one. This library maintains a state engine for game logic with an exposed API for Lua scripts. It is independent of the YGOPro client and can be used to power other technologies.

## Compiling
See the [main EDOPro wiki](https://github.com/edo9300/ygopro/wiki/) for details.

## Documentation
